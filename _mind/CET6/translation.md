### Note

从语法结构和语义上看,以下两组句子基本上是等同的:
Most, The most
1a. What people talk about most is xxx.
1b. What people talk about the most is xxx.
2a. The hobby I like most is xxx.
2b. The hobby I like the most is xxx.
然而,在实际使用中,以下几点细微差别值得注意:

在第一组句子中,使用most作为副词修饰talk可能更常见,因为它强调了"谈论"这个动作的频率。而使用the most作为形容词修饰what可能稍显正式。
在第二组句子中,使用the most作为形容词修饰hobby可能更常见,因为它强调了"爱好"这个名词本身的程度。而使用most作为副词修饰like可能稍显口语化。
在口语中,人们可能更倾向于使用most而不是the most,因为前者更简洁。而在正式写作中,使用the most可能更常见,因为它在语法上更加完整和精确。

尽管如此,这些差别非常细微,在大多数情况下,这两种表达方式可以互换使用,不会影响句子的意思。重要的是要在特定的语境中保持一致,以避免不必要的混淆

>By guiding the government and social participation, more and better pension service institutions can be established, community service centers can be improved, home-based self-care can be encouraged, and a combination of family care and social care can be implemented.

被动语态似乎不是很信达雅

**Establishing** more and better pension service institutions, **improving** community service centers, **encouraging** home-based self-care, and **implementing** a model that combines family care with social care.

用动名词的形式更好

- implementing a model that combines family care with social care
  - implementing a **combined** model with family care and social care
  - implementing a **hybrid** model with family care and social care
