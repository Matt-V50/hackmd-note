- 卢沟桥位于天安门广场西南15公里处，横跨永定河，是北京现存最古老的多拱石桥。卢沟桥最初建成于1192年，1698年重建，由281根柱子支撑。每根柱子上都有一头石狮。这些石狮的头、背、腹部或爪子上都藏着更多的狮子。这些石狮生动逼真、千姿百态，是卢沟桥石刻艺术的精品。桥上的石狮不计其数，因而北京地区流传着“卢沟桥上的石狮子——数不清”的说法。卢沟桥不仅以其美学特征闻名于世，还被公认为石桥建筑史上的一座丰碑

- 赵州桥建于隋朝，公元605年左右，长50.82米，宽9.6米，跨度37.37米。天才建筑师李春设计并监督了桥的建设。赵州桥结构新颖、造型优美。桥有一个大拱，在大拱的两端有两个小拱，帮助排泄洪水、减轻桥梁重量并节省石材。建成以来，该桥经受了多次洪水和地震，但其主体结构仍然完好无损，至今仍在使用。赵州桥是世界桥梁建筑史上的一次创举，是中国古代文明史上的一项杰出成就。类似设计的桥梁直到14世纪才在欧洲出现，比赵州桥晚了700多年。

First, I looked at both response codes. The first one tries to reverse the number with array operations, and the second one tries to return a negative number from the input argument.
Although neither of them worked for the prompt input, the first one has an answer closer to the five requirements of the prompt input.
They both provide code in their responses and implement a function that receives an integer argument. However, they both give the wrong function for the given prompt. The first one will raise a grammar error, but it is close to the fifth requirement.
So response1 is better
