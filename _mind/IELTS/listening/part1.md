## Q: What subject do you think is the most challenging at school?

Off the top of my head, I have to say, English is the toughest subject for me. Not only because i'm not a native speaker, but also it is very hard to find another or purely English speaking environment. I have to read tons of papers which are written in English. To be honest, I spend a lot of time to understand the academic concepts. It considerably slows down my reading speed. I'd say this is the biggest challenge for me.

## Q: Do you ask for help when you have a problem?

To be honest, I'm not the kind of person who asks for help easily. Firstly, I prefer to solve the problem by myself all the time. I think every challenging task is a good opportunity to improve my problem-solving skills. However, It also depends on how quickly I need to complete the task. As the old saying goes, if I bite off more than one can chew, I'd better seek assistance from anyone available that could help me effectively. I think more important skill is to recognize the limit of my own abilities, to decide whether I need help or not.

## Q: What did you enjoy doing as a child?

To be honest, I didn't have a very happy childhood, and I don't have too many clear memories from that period. Most of them are about arguments between my parents. However, there is one thing that I enjoyed very much. Since I lived in the northeast of China, I had a long period to play with snow on the mountain near my home. Building snowmen and having snowball fights were my favorite activities. These moments of joy provided a much-needed escape from the tense atmosphere at home. But I must admit, it was very hard to make friends in my little hometown. Therefore, I really cherished and enjoyed those great moments in the snow. Looking back, I realize that those experiences taught me to find happiness in simple things and to appreciate the beauty of nature.

## Q: Are you a person who likes to stay at home

- 我的： To be honest, I'm not the kind of person who likes to stay at home in my free time. I have a strong preference for outdoor activities. Not only because I can get the energy from the nature, but also I really enjoy the conversation with new friends. You can always learn new things and new opinion from their minds. Sometimes, most of these kind of relationships just like a spark, which will vanish in a few days, but I can strongly feel that my horizon is explored by those people. On the other hand, I can't imagine that how I waste a whole day at home. I'd prefer to enjoy the sunshine outside.

- 改的：To be honest, I'm not the kind of person who enjoys staying at home during my free time. I have a strong preference for outdoor activities, not only because I can draw energy from nature, but also because I genuinely enjoy conversations with new friends. I believe that you can always learn new things and gain fresh perspectives from others. Although most of these relationships might be fleeting, vanishing like a spark within a few days, I can strongly feel that my horizons are broadened by interacting with these people. On the other hand, I can't imagine wasting an entire day cooped up at home. Given the choice, I'd much prefer to be outside, soaking up the sunshine.

- "genuinely enjoy" 强调了你的真实感受。
- "gain fresh perspectives" 表达了从他人那里获得新见解的意思。
- "fleeting" 和 "cooped up" 是两个很好的高级词汇,分别表示"短暂的"和"闷在家里"。

Now, it's considered one of the top universities in China and is ranked highly worldwide.

## Q: Have you ever tried any exciting activities

I have tried a lot of exciting activities in my life. Most of them are related to intense sport. Off the top of my head, the most exciting activities is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, a kind of kung fu, but it's focus on how to win the match by controling your competitor's body. In general, it's not only about fight with your power from muscle, but also more about your intelligence. Considering all steps and finding the best strategy from them is the only way to reach the game. That's why I feel exciting every time when I play it.

- 修改后：I have tried many exciting activities in my life, most of them are related to intense sports. For example, one of the most exciting activities I've experienced is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, a martial art that focuses on grappling and ground fighting. What I find particularly exciting about Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is that it's not just about using your physical strength; it heavily relies on your intelligence and strategy. You have to consider all possible moves and find the best approach to outmaneuver your opponent. Moreover, the adrenaline rush and the sense of accomplishment after a challenging match are incredibly rewarding. That's why I feel excited every time I practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

## Q: What did you often do with your friends in your childhood?

To be honest, I didn't have many friends when I was a child. It was too hard to find a stable relationship in my tiny hometown which had total polution only about 3000. Most of time I spent was reading book along. However, I had one or two weeks to play with my cutsion who lived in other faraway city in the summer holiday. The only clear memory that I can remember is that we planed to going fish by using mooncake as fish bait. And you can imagine that how thing's going. We got nothing back, except two wet pants. But I must admit, it was a very happy time for me. I really cherish those moments.

But I must admit, it was a very happy time for me. I really cherish those moments.

## Q: Which do you prefer, e-books or paper books

To be honest, I prefer e-books more than paper books. Long time ago, I used to read paper book page by page, and, sometimes, I liked to write notes at the margin of the page. However, as times went, I have to manage and clean those books in every 6 months, escpecially when I need to move to my new house. I didn't realize that I had read so many books before. But now, not only because the convinence the e-books brought to me, but also I like the sharing function the most. Just by click twice, I can share the golden santances to my best friends. It is really important that you can make new friends who have the same mind through social media.

I didn't realize how many books I had read until I needed to move to my new house. As time passed, I had to organize and **declutter** those books every 6 months, especially when moving. But now, I appreciate not only the convenience e-books bring but also their sharing function the most. Just by clicking twice, I can share golden sentences with my best friends. Moreover, I enjoy the fact that e-books allow me to connect with like-minded people through social media.

## Q: Are you interested in news?

To be honest, I'm not a big fan of news unless the social media post counts. In my perspective, nowadays, most of news they all have their own standing position. It would like to use more and more metaphor and rhetoric to stengthen their own opinion. However, I can get the real information by aggrement from different social media source. Except minor media companies, I believe that most of official media channel have propaganda purpose. Therefore, I perfer to read the news from the social media more than official news.

However at that time, I didn't realize what is the internet in the global wide. Looking back, I think I started to use the internet when I was in high school. But most of time, since we didn't have very fast connect speed, I used to play a kind of text game in my free time. I think it is the start point of my internet life.

- 修改后：Wow, that's a really good question. It **takes me back** to my middle school days. I still remember that I used to play a game called "Red Alert", which used a local area network to connect players. However, at that time, I didn't **fully understand the concept** of the internet on a global scale. Looking back, I think I started to use the internet when I was in high school.

To be honest, actually, I'm a kind of neight owl person, which means, I usually get up at a very late time. Therefore, I don't have the habit to eat breakfast, unless lunch counts. I offen eat some noodle in the winter, cause the soup could worm my stomach. But in the summer, I prefer to eat some fried rice with eggs. No need to wait too long at the line. And easy t o eat them all, nothing left. I pretty like this kind of life style.

Well, we all known that, nowaday, the internet and the e-books provid a huge convinence for us to get the information that we need. Therefore, the majorty of paper book reader in China are those people who have to search and check the source materials. In my observations, there's really rare kids in library.

To be honest, I don't know these small businesses too much. It may be because these small businesses are hiden by the huge platform, such as Taobao, nobody care about the unknown brand anymore, unless you are one of the supplier instead of the customer. If 711 could be count as business which is small enough, I think, that is the only one that I can recall.
