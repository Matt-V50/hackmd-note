## 虚拟语气

虚拟语气(subjunctive mood)在英语中有几种常见的句子结构:

- If 虚拟条件句
  - 结构: If + 主语 + 过去式/were (主语为I/he/she/it时用were)
  - 例如: If I were you, I would study harder.
- 表示建议/要求的主句
  - 结构: 主语 + 动词原形
  - 例如: I suggest (that) he go to the doctor.
- 反事实虚拟语气
  - 结构: 主语 + should/could/would/might + have + 过去分词
  - 例如: He could have been more careful.
- 祈使虚拟语气
  - 结构: 动词原形 (省略主语it)
  - 例如: God bless you. (愿上帝保佑你)
- 假如从句
  - 结构: As if/As though + 主语 + 过去式
  - 例如: She looks as if she were ill.
- 表达愿望的句子
  - 结构: 主语 + wish/hope/pray + 主语 + 动词原形
  - 例如: I wish I knew the answer.
- 总的来说,虚拟语气主要用于表达:
  - 与事实相反的假设前提
  - 建议或恳求
  - 表达愿望
  - 反事实推测
- 例句
  - "If you **had wanted to** pass the exam, you **should have listened** to my advice."
  - "If you want to pass the exam, you should listen to my advice."
  - I could have been a doctor if I had studied harder. (我本可以成为一名医生,如果我当时更加用功的话)
  - You should have listened to my advice. (你本应该听从我的建议)
  - If he hadn't overslept, he would have caught the train. (如果他没有睡过头,他本可以赶上那班火车)
- 虚拟语气的常见用法:
  - 与现在事实相反的假设:
    - 从句 done, 主句 should/could/would/might do
    - If I **were** you, I **would study** harder.(与事实相反,我不是你)
  - 与过去事实相反的假设:
    - 从句 had done, 主句 should/could/would/might have done
    - If I **had studied** harder, I **would have passed** the exam.(与事实相反,我没有更努力学习)
  - 表示愿望、建议等:
    - I wish I could speak fluent English.(表达愿望,事实上我英语还不够流利)
    - I wish I had more free time.
    - I wish I could fly.
    - I wish he would stop talking.
    - I wish I had studied harder.
  - 在某些从句中,如time clause, it's time, would rather, as if 等:
    - as if:
      - as if/as though + 主语 + 过去式动词
        - He speaks **as if he were** an expert.
        - (他说话的样子好像他是专家一样,事实上他不是)
        - He **talks as though he knew** everything about the subject, but in reality, he's just a beginner.
        - (他说话的样子好像他对这个主题无所不知,但实际上,他只是一个初学者。)
    - It's time + 主语 + 过去式动词
      - **It's time we had** a serious talk about our relationship.
      - (我们是时候认真讨论一下我们的关系了。)
    - would rather + 主语 + (**主句形式**)
      - I **would rather you didn't smoke** in the house.
      - (我宁愿你不要在房子里抽烟。**过去式表现在**)
      - I **would rather you had not smoked** in the house.
      - (我宁愿你没在房子里抽过烟。**过去完成时表过去**)
      - She **would rather he told her** the truth than lied to her.
      - (她宁愿他告诉她真相,也不愿他对她撒谎。)
    - If only + 主语 + 过去式动词/过去完成时
      - **If only I had** more free time, **I could travel** around the world.
      - (要是我有更多空闲时间,我就能环游世界了。)
      - **If only I had studied** harder, **I would have passed** the exam.
      - (要是我当时学习更努力,我就能通过考试了。)
- 原则
  - 主句用would/should/could/might + 动词原形,从句用过去式。
  - 主句用would/should/could/might have + 过去分词,从句用过去完成式

## 非谓语结构(Nonfinite Clause)

- 动词不定式结构 (Infinitive Phrase)
  - 例如："to sell their products"
- 动名词结构 (Gerund Phrase)
  - The teacher said that the students **talking in the classroom** would be punished
  - 例如："wanting to sell their products"
- 现在分词结构 (Present Participle Phrase)
  - 例如："selling their products"
  - The lady **wearing a red hat** is my teacher.
  - I saw a boy **playing football** in the park. 
  - The man **driving the car** is my father.
  - I watched the leaves **falling from the trees**.
- 过去分词结构 (Past Participle Phrase)
  - 例如："sold their products"

### 区分动名词和现在分词

- "Swimming is my favorite sport."
  - "Swimming" 是主语，所以是动名词。
- "I saw a girl swimming in the pool."
  - "swimming" 修饰 "girl"，所以是现在分词。
- "He is good at playing the piano."
  - "playing" 跟在介词 "at" 后面，所以是动名词。
- "Playing the piano, he didn't notice me come in."
  - "Playing the piano" 在句首作状语，描述主语 "he" 的动作，所以是现在分词。
